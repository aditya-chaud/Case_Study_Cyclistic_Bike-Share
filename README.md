Case Study 1: How Does a Bike_Share Navigate Speedy Success?

Case Study Description:
This is a case study done as a capstone project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Here I analyzed usage patterns of casual riders and annual members at Cyclistic bike-share company in Chicago to inform and suggest a data-driven marketing strategy and recommendations for converting casual riders to annual members.

About Data:
The datasets are taken from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. This is public data made available by Motivate International Inc. under the license https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement.

The dataset contains the records of customer from last 12 months ie from 2019 q2 to 2020 q1. Since there is only a single quarter records of 2020AD I have used three quarters of 2019AD and the first quarter of 2020AD. The dataset contains data about the trips from one station to another for two different usertypes ie. customer and subscriber. Subscriber is the person who has subscribed to annual membership and customer is the one who purchases single-ride or full-day passes.
